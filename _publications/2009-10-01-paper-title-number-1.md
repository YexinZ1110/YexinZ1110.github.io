title: "Noncontact Particle Manipulation on Water Surface with Ultrasonic Phased Array System and Microscopic Vision"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we report our latest research regarding dexterous and dynamic noncontact micro-particle manipulation on water surface effected by acoustic field in terms of automated trapping, closed-loop positioning, and real-time motion planning, which can be applied to scenarios such as parallel 3D printing, cell assembly, etc. The main contribution of this work is we demonstrated the feasibility of objective-oriented and fully utomated acoustic manipulation of micro-particle in precision scale based on robotic approach in 2D plane. Experiment results showed that the repetitive positioning accuracy can reach as high as 16 micrometer, which is essentially the pixel scale factor.'
