excerpt: 'In this paper, we present an ultrosonic manipulation of micro-object with large aspect ratio. The technique is based on an acoustic tweezer platform and a real-time acoustic field construction algorithm based on holographic redundancy principle. It enables precise manipulation of micro-objects with large aspect ratio at the micrometer level, including automatic trapping and positioning, demonstrating the feasibility of applying robotic methods in precision acoustic operations. This study provides an effective solution for non-contact manipulation of micro-objects with large aspect ratio, with great potential for a wide range of applications in circuit assembly and advanced manufacturing.'

**Abstract**
Acoustic manipulation has been focusing on spherical particles, such as droplets and cells. However, micro-object with irregular shapes is more popular in broader appllication scenarios, such as microelectronics. In this paper, we present an ultrosonic manipulation of micro-object with large aspect ratio. The technique is based on an acoustic tweezer platform and a real-time acoustic field construction algorithm based on holographic redundancy principle. It enables precise manipulation of micro-objects with large aspect ratio at the micrometer level, including automatic trapping and positioning, demonstrating the feasibility of applying robotic methods in precision acoustic operations. This study provides an effective solution for non-contact manipulation of micro-objects with large aspect ratio, with great potential for a wide range of applications in circuit assembly and advanced manufacturing.
